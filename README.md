This repository contains csv results and fixtures for the top-tier of English Rugby: the Gallagher Premiership (previously known as the Aviva Premiership, Guinness Premiership or Zurich Premiership). The repository contains matches from the 2008-09 season to the present day.
Many of the headings are self-explanatory. Information has been gathered from the Wikipedia pages for each season of the tournament.


**Defintions**

'Crowds' is a dummy variable indicating whether crowds were present at the fixture. Due to the Covid pandemic this has only recently been an issue.

'Neutral venue' is a dummy variable indicating whether the match took place at neither the Home Team or Away Team. Typically this only includes matches like the season final, but may also have included some matches affected by Covid.

'Tries Scores H' and 'Tries Scored A' have been included for the most recent results and denote how many tries the Home and Away teams scored, respectively.


**Caveats and limitations**

There may be some inaccuracies with the date of each match. While most matches take place over a Friday/Saturday/Sunday of a weekend, many of the dates in the _result_ files and all the dates in the _fixtures_ file will default to the Saturday of that weekend.
